-Problems With This Infrastructure
- Server is a Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
This infrastructure design has no redundant server as a backup if the single server present failed. This presents a "single point of failure" as the application would crash due to the malfunctioning of the server.
- Downtime In Maintenance
Rebooting of the server after maintenance practice e.g deploying new code, would cause a downtime as the sole server would be unavailable for that period of time to carry out its functionalities for the clients.
- Unscalability
This infrastructure is unscalable due to its single server, web server, application server and absence of a load balancer to handle multiple requests to it.

Protocol
The server here uses the TCP/IP protocol to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website.
